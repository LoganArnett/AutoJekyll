      <h2>What is AutoJekyll</h2>
      <p class="main-para">AutoJekyll is a tool developed by a graduate of <a href="https://theironyard.com/locations/orlando">The Iron Yard Orlando's</a> Front End Engineering program. It is an AngularJS web app that allows the user to setup a nice and easy workflow for their <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog that is hosted through <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. Well technically it can be wired up for a number of different uses and applications but that was the original idea.  </p>
      
      <p class="main-para">The Add A New Post screen allows the user to type in posts in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown</a> syntax and watch a live preview of their post side by side. This is a great way to begin getting comfortable with typing in markdown because you get real time feedback.</p>
      
      <p class="main-para">After you have completed your post to your own satisfaction you can make sure you have filled in the proper date for the post, the post title, and the commit message that you would like to appear in your Github repo for this added post. No more having to go into your IDE and terminal just to type, save, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` back up to the master branch on github. AutoJekyll does all of this work for you straight from the browser through your gh-pages USERNAME.github.io site.</p>
